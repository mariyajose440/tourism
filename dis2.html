                        Kathakali :It is a classical dance drama that is also popular in Thiruvananthapuram. It displays elaborate costumes,
                         make-up and movements that combine to create a dramatic effect on the audience. It is said to have been created in the
                          17th century by the raja of Kottarakarra and incorporates elements from various indigenous dances. It usually enacts 
                          stories from the Mahabharata and various other classical texts, set to Carnatic music. Traditionally, performances begin
                           at night and end in the morning and require a lot of stamina and concentration.

                        Kuchipudi, Kathak and Odissi. The popularity of Bollywood and western dances such as salsa is also spreading with many

                <h5>Seethakali</h5>
                The unique and flamboyant Seethakali is a centuries-old folk art form that is believed to have originated at Perinad in Kollam district.
                 This art form was first performed some 150 years back by the people of Vedar and Pulayar communities.
                 <br><br>

                Seethakali is based on certain episodes taken from the Indian epic Ramayana. Mythic characters such as Rama, Seetha, Ravana and Hanuman come alive in Seethakali performances that portray the tale
                 of Seetha’s journey, from the time she accompanied Rama to the woods till her ascent to the heavens.
