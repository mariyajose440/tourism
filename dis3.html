                    <li>Kathakali is one of the main dance forms of India. It is generally displayed in the form of ballet or dance-drama.
                         Ideally, Kathakali insinuates the depiction of a story in the manner of a play. This form of ballet has originated 
                         from a feud between two royal families. Whereas one of them showcased the dance-drama in Sanskrit, circling the life of 
                        Lord Krishna (Krishnattam), the other ruler depicted the life of Lord Rama</li>

                         and his wife and is characterized by dramatic gestures and facial expressions. It can be performed solely, in a group 
                         or as a dance drama.

            </button>
            <div class="drpcont"> Alappuzha is a Land Mark between the broad Arabian sea and a network of rivers flowing into it.In the early first decade of
                 the 20th Century the then Viceroy of the Indian Empire, Lord Curzon made a visit in the State to Alleppey, now Alappuzha. Fascinated by the
                  Scenic beauty of the place, in joy and amazement, he said, “Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties”. In his exhilaration,
                   it is said, he exclaimed, “Alleppey, the Venice of the East”. Thus the sobriquet found its place in the world Tourism Map. The presence of
                    a port and a pier, criss -cross roads and numerous bridges across them, a long and unbroken sea coast might have motivated him to make this
                    comparison.
                Alleppey has a wonderful past. Though the present town owes its existence to the sagacious Diwan Rajakesavadas in the second half of 
                18th century, district of Alappuzha figures in classified Literature. Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala with the unending stretch of paddy 
                fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms , was well known even from the early periods of the Sangam age.
                 History says Alappuzha had trade relations with ancient Greece and Rome in B.C and in the Middle Ages. </div>
