                The cuisine of Thrissur is linked to its history, geography, demography and culture of the land. Mainly Rice is the s
                taple food of the people in Thrissur. Typically, Thrissur Hindus are not vegetarians, though some individual members may avoid 
                non-vegetarians. Muslims and Christians, that are predominantly non-vegetarians use fish, poultry and meat. The routine dietary in a
                 family consists of breakfast, lunch, tiffin and supper. Kanji or Rice gruel with some vegetable curry and pickles formed the main
                  breakfast until very recently in almost all families, but it has now been replaced by tea, coffee or other beverages taken along with dishes
                 like Dosai, Iddali, Poori, Chappathi and Uppuma.
