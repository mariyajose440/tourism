                Kannur is dubbed as the City of Looms and Lores, thanks to the flourishing handloom industry and folk art called Theyyam.
                 Theyyamis a ritualistic artform encompassing dance, music and mime, where the artist dons the guise of God. 
                Kannur is believed to have got its name from being the land of Kannan or Krishna.

                Also known as Kadukka, kallumakkaya or mussels is the one seafood that can play as the icon icon for Northern Kerala cuisine.
                This one dish, unique to the region, can be found on almost every nook and corner of Kannur. It take some effort to make the 
                perfect mussels as it is hard to clean and process them. But it’s worth the effort. Nothing can beat these chewy and fleshy 
                seafood when blended with the right spices.

                Theyyam (Teyyam, Theyam, Theyyattam) is a popular ritual form of dance worship in Kerala and Karnataka, India. Theyyam consisted 
                of several thousand-year-old traditions, rituals and customs. The performers of Theyyam belong to the lower caste community in 
                ancient caste structure formed by Namboothiri brahmins in Kerala, and have an important position in Theyyam. 
                The people of these districts consider Theyyam itself as a channel to a God and they thus seek blessings from Theyyam. 
                It is performed by mainly by males, except the Devakoothu theyyam. The Devakoothu is the only Theyyam ritual performed by women.
                [1]It is performed only on the Thekkumbad Kulom temple.[2]In Kerala, Theyyam is performed predominantly in the Kolathunadu area (consisting of present-day Kasargod, Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk 
                of Wayanad and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode) and in Karnataka in South Canara and Kodagu. A similar custom is followed 
                in the Mangalore region of neighbouring Karnataka known as Bhuta Kola.
